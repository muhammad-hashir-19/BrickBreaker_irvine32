# BrickBreaker_irvine32
# Description
This is the generalized brick breaker game in assembly with few modifications.
This game is fully made using Irvine32.inc along with macros.inc (No DOSBOX used).
The code has a lot of redundant features due to using similar functions for all 3 levels.
# Installation
Need an Irvine setup for this game.
Add Irvine to your IDE environment to run the code.
I personally used Visual Studio for this .
